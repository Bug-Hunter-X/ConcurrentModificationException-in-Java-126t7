This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the ConcurrentModificationException and its solution. The ConcurrentModificationException occurs when a collection is modified structurally (e.g., elements are added or removed) while it is being iterated over using an iterator that does not support concurrent modification.  The solution showcases safe ways to modify a list while iterating.
